# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis — Superstore Dataset

A data analytics project exploring sales performance using SQL and Python.  
This project demonstrates my ability to write SQL queries, analyze data using Pandas, visualize insights with Matplotlib, and structure a real-world analysis using Jupyter Notebook and SQLite.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a fictional U.S.-based Superstore to uncover key business insights.

**Key questions addressed:**

- Which region generated the most sales?  
- What are the top-selling products?
